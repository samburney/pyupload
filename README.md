# pyupload

`pyupload` is a new Python-based replacement for [simplegallery](https://github.com/samburney/simplegallery), a semi-anonymous file, image, and video storage service.

**This project is currently under active development.**

## Project Goals

- **Modern Stack**: Transition from PHP/Laravel 4.2 to a modern Python web framework.
- **Legacy Compatibility**: Maintain support for the existing `simplegallery` database schema and file storage layout.
- **Enhanced Features**: Provide a responsive, dynamic user interface and improved file processing capabilities.
