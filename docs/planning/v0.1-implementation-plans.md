# Implementation Plans for v0.1 Release

This document provides an overview of all implementation plans needed to achieve v0.1 release with feature parity to simplegallery's core functionality.

## Overview

The v0.1 release focuses on delivering the essential features needed for pyupload to replace simplegallery as a functional file upload and sharing service. The implementation is divided into 4 major plans, each addressing a critical area of functionality.

## Implementation Plans

### 1. File Serving Endpoint
**File**: `implement-file-serving.md`  
**Priority**: Critical (Blocker for v0.1)  
**Estimated Effort**: Medium (2-3 days)

**Summary**: Implement secure file serving with access control, view counting, and proper MIME type handling.

**Key Features**:
- `/get/{id}/{filename}` endpoint for file delivery
- Access control enforcement (private files owner-only)
- View counter increment on file delivery
- Proper Content-Type and Content-Disposition headers
- Remove temporary `/files/` static route

**Dependencies**: None

**Why Critical**: Currently files are served via temporary static route with no access control. This is a security risk and prevents proper view counting and privacy enforcement.

### 2. Upload View Page
**File**: `implement-upload-view-page.md`  
**Priority**: Critical (Blocker for v0.1)  
**Estimated Effort**: Large (4-5 days)

**Summary**: Create individual upload detail pages with metadata display, sharing options, inline editing, and delete functionality.

**Key Features**:
- Individual view page at `/view/{id}/{filename}`
- File preview (images inline, videos with player)
- Metadata display (size, dimensions, type, views, date)
- Share links with copy-to-clipboard
- Inline editing for title/description (owner only)
- Privacy toggle (owner only)
- Delete functionality (owner/admin only)

**Dependencies**: 
- File serving endpoint (for file preview)

**Why Critical**: Users need a way to view, manage, and share their uploads. This is core functionality for any file sharing service.

### 3. Home Gallery Page
**File**: `implement-home-gallery.md`  
**Priority**: High (Important for v0.1)  
**Estimated Effort**: Medium (2-3 days)

**Summary**: Implement home page with gallery of latest public uploads for discovery and browsing.

**Key Features**:
- Gallery grid layout with thumbnails
- Display latest public uploads only
- Pagination for browsing
- Responsive design (1-4 columns)
- Link to upload view pages
- Empty state handling

**Dependencies**: 
- Upload view page (for linking)

**Why Important**: Provides discovery mechanism and landing page experience. Without this, users can only access their own uploads via profile page.

### 4. UI Polish and Navigation
**File**: `implement-ui-polish.md`  
**Priority**: Medium (Nice to have for v0.1)  
**Estimated Effort**: Medium (3-4 days)

**Summary**: Polish user interface with improved navigation, responsive design, and UX enhancements.

**Key Features**:
- Complete responsive navigation menu
- User dropdown with profile/logout links
- Improved flash message styling
- Breadcrumb navigation
- Site footer
- Form styling and validation feedback
- Loading states and transitions
- Accessibility improvements

**Dependencies**: 
- All other plans (this is final polish)

**Why Medium Priority**: Improves user experience but not blocking for basic functionality. Can be partially implemented or deferred to v0.1.1 if needed.

## Recommended Implementation Order

1. **File Serving Endpoint** (implement-file-serving.md)
   - Blocking dependency for other features
   - Security critical
   - Relatively self-contained

2. **Upload View Page** (implement-upload-view-page.md)
   - Depends on file serving
   - Core user-facing functionality
   - Largest implementation effort

3. **Home Gallery Page** (implement-home-gallery.md)
   - Depends on upload view page
   - Provides discovery and landing page
   - Reuses components from upload view

4. **UI Polish and Navigation** (implement-ui-polish.md)
   - Final polish after core features
   - Can be done incrementally
   - Some steps can be deferred if needed

## Success Criteria for v0.1

After completing these implementation plans, pyupload should:

- ✅ Allow users to upload files securely
- ✅ Serve files with proper access control
- ✅ Display individual upload pages with metadata
- ✅ Allow owners to edit, delete, and control privacy
- ✅ Provide a home page for discovering public uploads
- ✅ Have a polished, responsive UI
- ✅ Be accessible and keyboard navigable
- ✅ Have comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ Be ready for production deployment

## Out of Scope for v0.1

The following features are documented in feature-parity.md but deferred to v0.2:

- Dynamic image resizing and thumbnails
- Format conversion
- Image rotation/transformation
- Collections and tags UI
- Search functionality
- Random and Popular galleries
- Advanced upload features (archive extraction, watermarking, EXIF)

## Estimated Timeline

- **File Serving**: 2-3 days
- **Upload View Page**: 4-5 days
- **Home Gallery**: 2-3 days
- **UI Polish**: 3-4 days

**Total**: 11-15 days of focused development

This assumes:
- One developer working full-time
- Includes testing and documentation
- Includes time for review and refinement
- May be faster with pair programming or multiple developers

## Next Steps

1. Review each implementation plan in detail
2. Refine and adjust based on project requirements
3. Begin implementation in recommended order
4. Track progress against TODO.md
5. Update plans as implementation progresses
