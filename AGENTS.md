INSTRUCTIONS FOR LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS
=====================================

Overview
--------

*simplegallery* is a very old file/image gallery upload application, written in PHP and build on the Laravel web framework.  *simplegallery* itself is the replacement of an older web application written in PHP from scratch.

*simplegallery* is the application powering https://upload.sifnt.net.au/, providing a semi-anonymous file, image and video storage service for the sifnt.net.au website and user forum, providing very similar functionalily to the popular Imgur service, though it predates it.

*simplegallery* was last updated in July 2019 when it was dockerised and updated to Laravel 4.2 for easier deployment to newer servers but is no longer maintained.

It is planned that *simpleupload* be replaced with a new application written in Python and using modern web frameworks.

*pyupload*, this project, is to be the replacement for *simplegallery*.  It is intended that *pyupload* provides the same simple user interface and that it, at least initially, adopts the same underlying database and filesystem structure as *simplegallery* whilst providing the foundation for future improvements.
